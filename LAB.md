====
## To Submit this Assignment
* Read this document entirely and estimate how long this assignment will take.
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Protect your repository's `master` branch by activating `continuous-integration/travis-ci` status checks
* Create a pull request from your `lab` + `<your name>` branch to your `master` branch
* Open a pull request to this repository
* Submit on canvas a question and observation,your original estimate, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request

## Requirements
#### Configuration
<!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include
  * **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  * **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  * **__test__/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests
  
#### Testing
[x] write at least three test assertions for each method of the Binary Tree Data Structure
* organize your tests into appropriate describe/test blocks for test output readability

#### Feature Tasks  
[x] Implement an **in-order** traversal function that returns a string of the visited nodes.
  * For example : `6,8,7,9,2,1,4,3,5`

####  Documentation
  [x] in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  [x] your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    [x] installing and using your data structure
    [x] accessing each method
    [x] running your tests

#### Rubric:
  [x] Tests: 2pts
  [x] Passes linter: 1pts
  [x] Completed Data Structure: 5pts
  [x] Big-O notation: 2pt
