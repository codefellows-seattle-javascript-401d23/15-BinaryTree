## Getting Started

1.Create a Node and the BinaryTree constructor.
2.Create a function to traverse through the nodes values and checks for the empty tree.
3.Create a string variable to store all the values that will be added from all the node values.
4.Test the function.

## Architecture
JavaScript, Node.js, Airbnb package, babelrc, nodemon, other dependencies
