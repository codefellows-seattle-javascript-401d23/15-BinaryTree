This file is a constructor for a binary tree, as well as an in-order traversal method on that tree.

The in order traversal takes a certain route through the tree and passes a root value to an array when it touches that root. 

The big O of this process is O(n) time, where n is number of nodes in the tree, and O(h) space, where h is the maximum height of the tree.
